Analyses and models pertaining to the great sport of baseball. 

Projects:
  - IdentifyingStingers: Stingers are a new classification for a batted-ball event (similar to a Barrel) that capture a batted-ball which results in a .700 AVG and 1.000 SLG.
  - StingerFormalization: Work-in-progress, has a pipeline that takes raw statcast data and returns a leaderboard containing a ton of stats and rates, as well as Stingers and Stinger rate. Contains models and shows the improvement of $R^2$ and MSE from using Stinger rate instead of a combination of hard-hit rate and sweet-spot rate (or individually).
  - HistoricalBaseballSalaryAnalysis: An R document which was an independent analysis of salary trends. Work-in-progress
  - BaseballSalaryPredictor: Trains model to predict players salary (normalized).
